## FAQ

**Q: The meter shows "Detecting AION2 connection..."**
A: Make sure AION 2 is running and the app has administrator privileges. If using a VPN or ping reducer, the app will detect the loopback adapter automatically.

**Q: My name doesn't appear on the meter**
A: Enter your character name and actor ID in Settings. The name is auto-detected from the AION 2 window title.

**Q: Npcap is installed but capture doesn't work**
A: Reinstall Npcap and ensure "WinPcap API-compatible Mode" is checked during installation.
